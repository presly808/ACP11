    Multithreading

        Lifecycle of threads
        synchronized blocks and methods
        Threads synchronization(wait, notify, notifyAll)

    all information learn by doing, write notes and draw all steps

    Design Patterns
        Observer, ProducerConsumer

2. Write own scheduler task
   That helps to run some task periodically

3. Implement search in file system without recursion (use queue) -> breadth-first search

4. Implement search in file system using (Threads): ThreadPool -> ExecutorService + Callable

5. Implement multithreading downloading from ex.ua using Producer-Consumer pattern
	Input some key word and start point(url), then start recursive searching
	When we will find:
	a) page url, go inside and find other urls in page
	b) file url ask about downloading(you can stop downloading at any time)

	One threads groups go through pages, other download files
	pattern ProducerConsumer

6. Implement asynchronous chat that allows communication with two and more users
        Must have
        - (saving history of messages into the file)
        - read connections setting(port, max users size, list of banned users)
            from server_settings.properties (see class Properties)
        - send message using Serialization (ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream)
        - for better architecture of application see pattern Observer
        - * write UI based on Swing
